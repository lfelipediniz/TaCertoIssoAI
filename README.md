# Fake News Detector - WhatsApp Bot

A WhatsApp chatbot for fact-checking and fake news detection using multimodal AI and fact-checking APIs.

## 🏆 Special Achievement
 
I am very happy and proud to share with you a new conquest:

**1st place at RAIA's Hackathon 2025**, whose theme was "AI for Information Quality: Understanding, Awareness and Trust in the Digital World".

In a world surrounded and driven by information, this subject shows a light on the right point: the fight against disinformation is an urgent challenge. Fake News are now even harder to detect and easier to share. Deep fakes, AI-generated images, texts and voices, automated bots and so on turn the work against misinformation through the internet into a real and deep problem nowadays. Remember: fake news can kill people (as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic), destroy nations and lead people to unhealthy and nonsense habits.

So, congratulations and special thanks to **RAIA - Rede de Avanço em Inteligência Artificial** for bringing up efforts to this cause, and to **Brasil Monks** for believing in it and turning this event possible.

Thinking about this case, our team led a project focused on the core of the phenomenon: **WhatsApp**. The place where the majority of fake news is shared, a fact which is powered by encryption and the difficulty of tracing its source. So, we created an automated bot for WhatsApp using an integration between LLM's, WhatsApp and Google Fact Check APIs, which can magnificently tell in an easy way to the user if information is true, false or overblown. Also, the bot can say why it is not real and show real sources about the information. It doesn't matter what kind of information it is: text? links? voices? images? The bot is based on multimodal AI and can analyze everything.

It was 12 hours of deep immersion in this application with my teammates passing through mountains of problem-solving and leading a real integration between every component of the team, each one in their mastered abilities, which result could be not other but the first place of the competition. Thank you so much.

## Introduction

**Fake News Detector** is a comprehensive fact-checking system that:
- Extracts verifiable claims from Portuguese text
- Retrieves evidence from trusted sources
- Uses LLM adjudication to provide verdicts with citations
- Supports text and multimodal analysis

## Architecture

**4-Step Pipeline:**
1. **Claim Extraction** - OpenAI LLM extracts verifiable claims from user input
2. **Evidence Retrieval** - Google Fact-Check API and other sources gather evidence
3. **LLM Adjudication** - Structured analysis produces verdicts with citations
4. **Response Formatting** - Clean API responses for WhatsApp integration

## Requirements

- [**Python 3.11+**](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- OpenAI API Key
- Google Fact-Check API Key (optional)

### Manual Execution

If you want to run manually or customize parameters:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lfelipediniz/TaCertoIssoAI
cd TaCertoIssoAI

# 2. Set up the environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# 4. Run the application
guvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Required environment variables:**
```env
# AI Services
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
```
